## Zelt Clone Design with Canvas Animation

This project aims to recreate the Zelt design with a futuristic aesthetic using canvas animation and minimal code. It's inspired by the work of @aadilkhan08.

**Features:**

* Canvas animation for a dynamic and futuristic Zelt-like design.
* Minimal code for readability and maintainability.

**Technologies:**

* HTML: Provides the basic structure of the web page.
* JavaScript: Utilizes the Canvas API for animation.
* CSS: Can be used for styling elements outside the animation (optional).

**Future Considerations:**

* User interaction: Allow for customization of animation behavior.
* Advanced animation techniques: Explore more complex effects and movements.
