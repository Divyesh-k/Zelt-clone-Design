## Zelt Clone Design with Canvas Animation

This project aims to recreate the Zelt design with a futuristic aesthetic using canvas animation and minimal code. It's inspired by the work of @aadilkhan08.

**Features:**

* Canvas animation for a dynamic and futuristic Zelt-like design.
* Minimal code for readability and maintainability.

**Technologies:**
